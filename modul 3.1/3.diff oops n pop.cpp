1....oops:;;-

=>object orianted.

=>program is divided into objects.

=>bottom-up approch.

=>inheritance property is used.

=>it uses access specifier.

=>encapusuluation is used to hide the data.

=>concept of virtual function.

=>object function are linked through message passing.

=> adding new data and function is easy.

=> the existing code can be reused.

=>use for solving big problems.

ex== c++,java


2..pop::-

=> structure oriented.

=>program is divided into functions.

=> top-down apporoch.

=>inheritance is allowed.

=>it doesn't use access specifier.

=>no data hideing.

=>no virtual function.

=>parts of program are linked through parameter passing.

=>expaning new data and function is not easy.

=>no code resubility.

=>not suitable for solving big problems.

ex:- c,pascal
